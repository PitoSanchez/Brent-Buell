      <div class="about-content">
        <p>
          Welcome to the world of Brent Buell, a multi-talented creative force
          whose work spans theater, film, and literature. Brent is a playwright,
          producer, director, and novelist whose passion for storytelling knows
          no bounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          For over ten years, Brent Buell brought powerful stories to life
          inside the walls of New York's maximum-security prisons, working with
          Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA). His directorial work included
          productions of classics like John Steinbeck's
          <em>Of Mice and Men</em>, as well as original pieces written by
          incarcerated individuals. His plays were met with acclaim, even
          drawing praise from <em>The New York Times</em>. His comedy
          <em>Breakin' the Mummy's Code</em>, which premiered inside Sing Sing,
          was highlighted in an <em>Esquire</em> article by bestselling author
          John Richardson and became an inspiration for the A24 film
          <em>Sing Sing</em>. In that film, Brent himself is portrayed by
          Oscar-nominated actor Paul Raci.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brent's belief in the transformative power of theater is evident
          through the impact of RTA: less than 3% of RTA participants ever
          return to prison, compared to the national average of over 60%. This
          work, and his chapter titled “Drama in the Big House” in Jonathan
          Shailor’s
          <em>Performing New Lives, Prison Theater</em>, documents these
          transformative experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brent's original works include <em>The Gem Exchange</em>, a comedy;
          <em>Wood Bars</em>, written with Miguel Valentin for the opening of
          Lin-Manuel Miranda, John Buffalo Mailer, and Tom Kail’s Back House
          Productions; and <em>The Gate</em>, a drama about parole co-written
          with Charles Moore. He also collaborated on the Las Vegas spectacular
          <em>Undone Divas</em> with Madelene Capelle. Brent has directed a
          variety of works including <em>unFRAMED</em> by Iyaba Ibo Mandingo,
          <em>From Sing Sing to Broadway</em>, and <em>Deathbed</em> by Mark
          Schultz, among others.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to his theater credits, Brent has taken part in several
          film projects. He wrote and directed <em>The Terrors of Teri</em>, a
          film for Ohio University, and directed <em>Moses</em>, an
          award-winning comedy for Goddess Films. He has also appeared in films
          like <em>Grand Opening</em> and <em>Al Quarem</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          His foray into the world of literature includes the novels
          <em>Rapturous</em>, a political parody, and
          <em>Daniel and My Revelation</em>. Brent is currently working on his
          memoir, <em>Sing Sing Backstage</em>, which chronicles his years of
          directing in prison and is set to be published in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brent Buell's work has always been about creating art that not only
          entertains but also inspires change and challenges our perspectives on
          justice and humanity. Welcome to his world, where storytelling breaks
          barriers and redefines what it means to be human.
