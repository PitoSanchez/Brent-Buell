      <h1 class="about-section-header">About Brent Buell</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the world of Brent Buell, a multi-talented creative force
        whose work spans theater, film, and literature. Brent is a playwright,
        producer, director, and novelist whose passion for storytelling knows no
        bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        For over ten years, Brent Buell brought powerful stories to life inside
        the walls of New York's maximum-security prisons, working with
        Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA). His directorial work included
        productions of classics like John Steinbeck's
        <em>Of Mice and Men</em>, as well as original pieces written by
        incarcerated individuals. His plays were met with acclaim, even drawing
        praise from <em>The New York Times</em>. His comedy
        <em>Breakin' the Mummy's Code</em>, which premiered inside Sing Sing,
        was highlighted in an <em>Esquire</em> article by bestselling author
        John Richardson and became an inspiration for the A24 film
        <em>Sing Sing</em>. In that film, Brent himself is portrayed by
        Oscar-nominated actor Paul Raci.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brent's belief in the transformative power of theater is evident through
        the impact of RTA: less than 3% of RTA participants ever return to
        prison, compared to the national average of over 60%. This work, and his
        chapter titled “Drama in the Big House” in Jonathan Shailor’s
        <em>Performing New Lives, Prison Theater</em>, documents these
        transformative experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brent's original works include <em>The Gem Exchange</em>, a comedy;
        <em>Wood Bars</em>, written with Miguel Valentin for the opening of
        Lin-Manuel Miranda, John Buffalo Mailer, and Tom Kail’s Back House
        Productions; and <em>The Gate</em>, a drama about parole co-written with
        Charles Moore. He also collaborated on the Las Vegas spectacular
        <em>Undone Divas</em> with Madelene Capelle. Brent has directed a
        variety of works including <em>unFRAMED</em> by Iyaba Ibo Mandingo,
        <em>From Sing Sing to Broadway</em>, and <em>Deathbed</em> by Mark
        Schultz, among others.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to his theater credits, Brent has taken part in several film
        projects. He wrote and directed <em>The Terrors of Teri</em>, a film for
        Ohio University, and directed <em>Moses</em>, an award-winning comedy
        for Goddess Films. He has also appeared in films like
        <em>Grand Opening</em> and <em>Al Quarem</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        His foray into the world of literature includes the novels
        <em>Rapturous</em>, a political parody, and
        <em>Daniel and My Revelation</em>. Brent is currently working on his
        memoir, <em>Sing Sing Backstage</em>, which chronicles his years of
        directing in prison and is set to be published in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brent Buell's work has always been about creating art that not only
        entertains but also inspires change and challenges our perspectives on
        justice and humanity. Welcome to his world, where storytelling breaks
        barriers and redefines what it means to be human.
