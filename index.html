        <h1>THEATER & TRANSFORMATION</h1>
        <p>
          Brent Buell is a playwright, producer, director, and novelist. He
          co-produced A24’s movie <em>Sing Sing</em>. For ten years, Buell
          directed theater with Rehabilitation Through the Arts (RTA) in New
          York’s maximum-security prisons, working on plays ranging from
          <em>Of Mice and Men</em> to original works by prisoners. His work has
          been praised by critics, including The New York Times. His play
          <em>Breakin’ the Mummy’s Code</em>, premiered inside Sing Sing and
          inspired A24’s <em>Sing Sing</em>.

        <h1>STORYTELLING LEGACY</h1>
        <p>
          Buell’s storytelling continues through his novels, including the
          political parody <em>Rapturous</em> and
          <em>Daniel and My Revelation</em>. His memoir,
          <em>Sing Sing Backstage</em>, documenting his years directing theater
          in prison, is set to be published. Buell's career showcases the
          transformative power of theater, with evidence showing less than 3% of
          RTA members returning to prison, compared to over 60% nationally.
